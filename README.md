          <p>Thousands of children around the country could get access to shelter, clothing, safe food and other essential utilities with the help of us all.</p>  
          <p>That's where Embrace A Child Network comes in. We exist to ensure neglected children enjoy basic parental care through individual and corporate contributions. There is both a need and demand for these contributions, because when children have access to basic care, they get time to go back to school, earn an income and improve their livelihood. It changes their world.</p>
          <p>With your help, we can provide these children with hope, health and the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty.</p>

          <p class="lead">Takunda is 11 years old and lived in the CBD of Harare for 3 years. He loves school and cricket. Without basic care, Takunda would spent time roaming around town gathering unsafe food. He was also getting into drugs.</p>
          <p class="lead">Thanks to Embrace A Child Network, Takunda got access to basic care that allowed him to resume his adventurous academic and sporting journey.</p>
          <hr>
          <p><strong>With access to basic care, Takunda can plan for the future he so dreams.</strong></p>
          <hr>
          <p>Takunda doesn't have to sleep in the open anymore, eat unsafe food or take dangerous drugs. Now he can plan for the future he deserves. That's the power of togetherness.</p>

          <h3>Why Not Adopt Now?</h3> 
          <p>Children are the same. It is every child's wish to be loved. Being part of a caring home and family is a fresh start to fulfilling such expectancy.</p>
          <p><strong>Stay up-to-date on children ready for adoption</strong></p>
          <!-- Slide show occurs here -->
          <p>We help the prospective adoptive family achieve it's desired opportunity to give a child a family.</p>
